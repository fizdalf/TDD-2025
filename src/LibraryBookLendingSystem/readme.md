This is a Book Lending System

We have a book lending system that identifies book by an ID (string)

We need to be able to add books to the system
We need to be able to borrow books from the system, if a book is already borrowed, you cannot borrow it until it's returned
We need to be able to return a book, this will allow someone to borrow it again.

This all can work on memory only.
